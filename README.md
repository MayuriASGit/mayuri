## Installation

1. Fork this repository to your github account
2. Clone the forked repository and proceed with steps mentioned below

### Install requirements

```
virtualenv env --python=python3.8
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Reset DB

```
export FLASK_APP=core/server.py
rm core/store.sqlite3
flask db upgrade -d core/migrations/
```
### Start Server

```
bash run.sh
```
### Installing Docker
1.	Install docker application
### Creating Docker file
2. Create a docker file with name `dockerfile` without any extension
3. Add
```
FROM python:3.8-slim-buster

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the entire local directory into the image
COPY . /app

# Activate virtual environment and install dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 4040
# Run bash script
CMD ["bash", "run.sh"]
```
in the dockerfile.
### Modifying run.sh
4. Open run.sh file and uncomment line 
```
# flask db upgrade -d core/migrations/
```
### Installing Ubuntu terminal and starting server
4. Install Ubuntu terminal and Run ` sudo apt-get install dos2unix` in ubuntu terminal
6. Run `sudo apt-get update` 
7. Run `dos2unix run.sh`
### Building Docker Image
8.Open git bash terminal in the project repository and Run command 
`docker build -t fylein-app .`
in your git bash terminal
9. Run command 
`docker run -p 4040:7755 fylein-app`
10. Everytime the image is to updated, we have to rebuild the docker container and hence have to run step 4 and 5 again, instead we can create a file named `docker-compose.yml` and add content 
`version: '3'
services:
  fylein-app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "4040:7755"
    volumes:
      - .:/src`
in it and then run `docker compose-up` which auto updates the image.


### Run Tests

```
pytest -vvv -s tests/

# for test coverage report
# pytest --cov
# open htmlcov/index.html
```
